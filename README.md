# School-Dance-
A fictional website advertising a school dance, organized with the webpack tool. 
https://macaroonforu.github.io/School-Dance-Webpack/

What makes this project "Special" is that the pages are written in javascript, the HTML file is basically just the boilerplate wtih a single div. 

To improve: 
- Need to add content to the tickets and contact us page
- Need to make the code cleaner because it was written in a rush.
